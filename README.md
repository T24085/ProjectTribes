# Project Tribes

This repository contains a collection of static HTML pages for the community around **Tribes 3: Rivals**. Each page focuses on tournament information, team rosters, or related utilities. Because all files are static, you can simply open them in a web browser—no web server or build step is required.

## Pages

- **TribesRivalsTeamsDashboard.html** – Main dashboard linking to individual team pages, streaming links, and historical information.
- **TournamentManager.html** – React-based page for managing tournaments and importing sign-up data.
- **TribesScrimWatcher.html** – Utility for previewing scrimmage matchups and team rosters.
- **TwitchFeedDisplays.html** – Layout for watching multiple Twitch streams at once.
- **TwitchFeedMobile.html** – Mobile-friendly version of the Twitch feeds display.
- **FatboysofSummerDashBoard.html** – Score-per-minute chart for a draft tournament.
- **Team*.html** – Individual team pages with logos, rosters, streams, and contact links. Teams include Avalanche, ePidemic, DPRK, Zen, TXM, Flag Pole Smokers, Flying Tractors, Hegemony of Euros, KTL, Magic, null, Tribal Therapy, Toxic Aimers, and Unhandled Exception.

## Usage

Open `TribesRivalsTeamsDashboard.html` in your browser to access the main dashboard. External team or stream links on each page open in new tabs.
Each team page provides roster info and may link to Twitch or YouTube streams.

The project is purely static—clone or download the repository and open the HTML files locally or host them via any static file hosting service.
