# ProjectTribes Layout Changes Summary

## Changes Made to index.html

### 1. Removed Spectating Section
- **Removed**: The entire dark blue "SPECTATING" section with the red button
- **Reason**: User requested to remove this section completely

### 2. Relocated Buttons to Stream Area
- **Moved**: "Load Caster (0o0o0)" and "View Team Stats" buttons
- **From**: Floating buttons in top-right corner (which were overlapping)
- **To**: Overlay controls in the top-right corner of the stream area
- **Benefits**: 
  - No more overlapping buttons
  - Better integration with stream interface
  - Always accessible when viewing stream
  - Professional overlay design with semi-transparent backgrounds

### 3. Removed Player Chat Section

### 4. Reordered Sidebar Elements
- **New Order** (top to bottom):
  1. **Live Chat** - Now at the top for maximum visibility

  3. **Live Viewers** - At the bottom
- **Reason**: User wanted chat to be most visible

- **New Layout Order**:
  1. **Active Stream** - Twitch video with overlay controls
